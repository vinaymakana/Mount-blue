SOLID DESIGN PRINCIPLES:Every module or class should have responsibilities over a single part of the functionalities provided by the software and responsibilities
Open And Close Principle:The design and writing of the code should be done in a way that new functionality should be added with minimum changesin the existing code
In the solid design principles helps to acheive reduction in complexity of code,increase readability,extensibility,and maintenance ,Reduce error and implement Reusability and achieve Better testability

SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIPLE                                                                                                                                    A Class should have only one reason to change and every module or class should have responsibility over asingle part of the functionality provided by the software,And then Motivation of the single responsibilty principles are Maintanability,Testability,Flexibility and Extensibility,Parallel Development,Loose coupling
INTERFACE SEGRAGATION PRINCIPLE                                                                                                                                          In their development process of new systems (PROBLEM)Zerox had created a new printer system that could perform a variety of tasks such stapling and faxing along with the regular printing task .The Software for the system was created form the ground up .Modification and Deployment to the sysytem because more complex (SOLUTION)One large job class is segragated to multiple interface depending on the requirement
OPEN CLOSED PRINCIPLE                                                                                                                                                    Open closed principles such as classes ,modules,functions etc,,.should be open for extensions,but close for modification
LISKOV SUBSTITUTION PRINCIPLE                                                                                                                                            L in the solid of accronime for LISKOV SUBSTITUTION PRINCIPLE                                                                                              Liskov Substitution principle is a particular of the defnition of a subtyping relation ,called strong behavioral subtyping and This principle is introduced by Barbara Liskov in 1987 .This principle is extension of the open close principle.    
DEPENDENCY INVERSION PRINCIPLE                                                                                                                                          High level modules should not depend on low lwvwl modules Both should depend on abstractions                                                                Abstractions should not depend on details.Details should depend on abstractions                                                                            The interaction between high level and low level modules should be thought of as an abstract interaction between them                              Intension of usage in Dependency Inversion Principle                                                                                                                          Presentation Layer > Bussiness Layer > DataAccess Layer   Limit the reuse opurtunities of higher level components from the illustrate depend on directly lower level modules and that first point of Dependency of inversion principle
